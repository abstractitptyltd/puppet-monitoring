Monitoring

Overview

Puppet module for managing puppet monitoring resources.
The base module sets up a few basic servies to monitor.

See the examples/node.pp file for examples on how to add more services to a node.
There are things missing that I need to add and I will get to them when I can.
If you would like a new service add a ticket to github and I will address it as soon as I can.
